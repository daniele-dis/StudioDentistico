# Studio-Dentistico
 Custom project made with Python as a backend and management of appropriately linked HTML frontend pages, in order to insert a patient, the treatments associated with them, the deletion of these, each in the patient's personal folder.

I know that there are some bad decision like putting the css style in the html statements but this was my first real project with Python and this is good for me because I notice the big step up that make every day.
